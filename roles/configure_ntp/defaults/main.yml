# This directory contains defaults for variables used in roles.
# I encourage you to define every variable used in your role, for several reasons:

# this file will be a nice and always up to date reference list of settings
# configuration in your roles having configured variables will prevent your
# role failing in an uncontrolled way (more on this later).
# If some of these variables are used in templates to generate config files,
# I highly encourage you to use your target OS defaults. The principle of least
# surprise should apply here.

# Best practices assumes that you are using pseudo-namespacing for your
# roleâ€™s variables (e.g. for role foobar, all variables should begin with foobar_)
# to avoid collisions with other roles.
